Based on geometry and G4sims structure from  IAXOD0-REST authored by Elisa Ruiz
Addapted to REST v2.2.10 from previous version RPE_IAXO authored by Cristian cogollos

IAXOD0 detector geometry where electronics are included inside the lead shielding.
Three different geometries are considered:
Argon_AGET_outside -> Chip outside shielding
Argon_AGET_halfway -> Chip at raquettelength/2 distance to the detector
Argon_AGET_closer -> Chip next to the detector
